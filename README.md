# Encoding-Faces-Within-Images

This AWS Lambda function processes images from S3, detects faces, and generates feature vector encodings for facial recognition tasks.

## Overview

This application is designed to:
1. Read an image file from an AWS S3 bucket
2. Detect faces in the image
3. Generate a feature vector encoding for the detected face
4. Return the encoding or store it for further processing

The encodings can be used by machine learning models for facial recognition tasks.

## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with permissions to create and manage Lambda functions and S3 buckets
- Python 3.8 or later
- AWS CLI (for deployment)

### Local Development

1. Clone this repository:
   gh repo clone MuziZwane/Encoding-Faces-Within-Images
   cd Encoding-Faces-Within-Images

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use         
   venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Test the face encoding function locally using sample images.

### Deployment to AWS Lambda

1. Ensure you have the AWS CLI configured with your credentials.

2. Create a deployment package:
   pip install --target ./package -r requirements.txt
   cd package
   zip -r ../deployment-package.zip .
   cd ..
   zip -g deployment-package.zip lambda_function.py   
   face_encoder.py

3. Create a Lambda function in the AWS Console or using the AWS CLI.

4. Upload the deployment package to your Lambda function.

5. Configure the Lambda function:
- Set the handler to `lambda_function.lambda_handler`
- Set the runtime to Python 3.8 or later
- Configure environment variables if necessary
- Set up appropriate IAM roles and permissions for S3 access

6. Set up an S3 trigger for your Lambda function to process new image uploads.

## Usage

Once deployed, the Lambda function will automatically process new images uploaded to the configured S3 bucket. The function will detect faces, generate encodings, and can be extended to store these encodings or return them as needed.

## Customization

- Modify `face_encoder.py` to use different face detection or feature extraction methods.
- Adjust the preprocessing steps in `preprocess_image()` function to fit your specific requirements.
- Extend the Lambda function to store encodings in a database or trigger further processing.

## Troubleshooting

- Check CloudWatch Logs for any error messages or unexpected behavior.
- Ensure that the S3 bucket and Lambda function are in the same region for optimal performance.
- Verify that the IAM role attached to the Lambda function has necessary permissions for S3 access.
